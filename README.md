# MMR-country-level-factors
This paper investigates the relationship between health expenditure and maternal mortality ratio (MMR) for international 2018 World Bank data. Employing various regression models that consider both private and government health expenditure, as well as their interactions with regional factors and GDP, this study uncovers noteworthy patterns. Overall, an increase in health expenditure per capita is associated with a decrease in MMR, with government health expenditure offering a greater decline compared to private expenditure. However, this association changes when analyzing health expenditure in relation to GDP â€“ increasing GDP and private health expenditure is correlated with elevated MMR. Furthermore, region can impact how MMR varies with a change in private health expenditure. Further research should be conducted at the intersection of health expenditure and MMR to understand the underlying influences and causality of this relationship.
